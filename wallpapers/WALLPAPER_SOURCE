Due to potential copyright issues, I have chosen not to upload my
wallpaper(s) here. However, my current wallpaper can be found at:
https://wallpapershome.com/space/exoplanet-planet-space-stars-5502.html

These dotfiles assume it will be placed in this folder and named
"exoplanet2.jpg". This can be changed on line 8 of bspwm/bspwmrc.
